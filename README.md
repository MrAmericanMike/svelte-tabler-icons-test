# Svelte-Tabler-Icons-Test

### The problem

After adding `@tabler/icons-svelte` to the project, each page that uses an icon becomes terrible slow to refresh

### Clone

Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MrAmericanMike/svelte-tabler-icons-test.git
```

Install Dependencies

```sh
cd svelte-tabler-icons-test
pnpm i
```

### DEV

Start the dev server

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Now when we visit `http://localhost:3000/` It should load and refresh fast.
If we go to the About page, it loads fast, however when we refresh this page, it gets stuck for a while.
